# QuasiSpaceMap

A tool for planning trips through quasi-space in the classic game Star Control II.

By clicking with the mouse or moving the cursor with the arrow keys and pressing *Enter*, select your origin and destination points on the map. If it will save you fuel to use the portal spawner (rather than flying straight to your desitination), the map will tell you how much fuel you will need, and which portal you should take.
